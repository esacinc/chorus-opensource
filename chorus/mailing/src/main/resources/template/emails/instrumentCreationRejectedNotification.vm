Hello, ${user}!

Unfortunately, your request to create ${instrument} instrument in ${laboratory} program has been rejected by the program head.
#if ($!comment != "")
    Here is the rejection comment:

#end

Perhaps, you may try to contact the program head directly and then repeat your request.

Thank you for your patience.
