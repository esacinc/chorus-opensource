Any use of the Open Source Components by Customer shall be governed by, and subject to, the terms and conditions of the Apache License.

                        <p>Stratus’ policy with respect to the handling of personal information and other information that Stratus may collect or which Customer may submit to Stratus shall be governed in all respects under Stratus’ privacy policy located at <a href="privacy-policy.html">www.chorusproject.org/privacy-policy.html</a>.</p>

                        <h3>Fees and Billings</h3>
                        <p>Customer shall pay all fees or charges to Customer’s account in accordance with the fees, charges, and billing terms in effect at the time a fee or charge is due and payable (collectively, “Service Fee”).  The initial charges for use of the Service will be equal the Service Fee currently in effect at the time Customer agrees to the terms of this Agreement (“Effective Date”).  Payments must be made annually in advance unless otherwise mutually agreed upon by the parties.  All payment obligations are non-cancelable and all amounts paid are nonrefundable.  Customer must provide Stratus with valid credit card or other billing information as a condition to signing up for the Service.  Stratus reserves the right to modify the Service Fees and to introduce new charges at any time, upon at least thirty (30) days notice to Customer, and any such change will be effective upon renewal and thereafter.  Stratus’ fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and Customer shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties, excluding only U.S. (federal or state) taxes based solely on Stratus’ income.  All pricing terms are confidential, and Customer agrees not to disclose them to any third party.</p>

                        <p>Data stored in Chorus can be separated into both private and public data.  Data made fully public will have no charge associated with the data storage.  The maximum storage space provided to Customer for private data at no additional charge is 200 GBs.  If the amount of private storage required by Customer exceeds this limit, Stratus has the right to charge Customer the then-current storage fees.  Stratus will use reasonable efforts to notify Customer when the storage used by Customer reaches approximately ninety percent (90%) of the maximum; however, any failure by Stratus to so notify Customer shall not affect Customer’s responsibility for such additional storage charges.  Stratus reserves the right to establish or modify its general practices and limits relating to storage of Customer Data.</p>

                        <p>Any breach of Customer’s payment obligations or unauthorized use by Customer of the Stratus Technology or Service will be deemed a material breach of this Agreement and Stratus may, in its sole discretion, terminate Customer’s account or use of the Service by providing notice to Customer.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Customer cures its failure to pay amounts due under this Agreement within ten (10) days of the date of the notice of such breach, Stratus shall not terminate Customer’s account or this Agreement.</p>
